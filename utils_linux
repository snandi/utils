*] To ssh/rcp/rsync without password prompting:

   Lets say you want to copy between two hosts host_A and host_B. host_A is the host where you would run 
   the scp, ssh or rsyn command, irrespective of the direction of the file copy! On host_A, run this 
   command as the user that runs scp/ssh/rsync

   ssh-keygen -t rsa

   This will prompt for a passphrase. Just press the enter key. It will then generate an identification 
   (private key) and a public key. Do not ever share the private key with anyone! ssh-keygen shows 
   where it saved the public key. This is by default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: Your public key has been saved 
   in <your_home_dir>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   
   Transfer the id_rsa.pub file to host_B by either ftp, scp, rsync or any other method. 
   On host_B, login as the remote user which you plan to use when you run scp, ssh or rsync on host_src. 
   Copy the contents of id_rsa.pub from host_A to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on host_B 
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

   All set!
